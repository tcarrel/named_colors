# named_colors
A header only library that provides definitions for the names of colors.
Currently there are about 990 colors defined with their hex color values.

There is also functionality provided to easily convert colors to tuples of four normalized doubles.
It's very simple but can be convenient in various applications.


The names and hex values come from:<br>
